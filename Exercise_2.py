Exercise_2 : Implement Stack using Linked List.

# Time Complexity :
- push(): O(1) - inserting at head of linked list
- pop(): O(1) - removing from head of linked list
- Both operations are true O(1)

# Space Complexity :
- O(n) where n is the number of elements in the stack
- Each node requires extra space for next pointer compared to array implementation

# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :
- Ran successfully on local machine with interactive input:
